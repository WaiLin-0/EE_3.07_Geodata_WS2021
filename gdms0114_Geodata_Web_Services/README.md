# Web Services

Web services comprise Web Mapping Services (WMS), Web Mapping Tiled Services (WMTS), Web Feature Services (WFS), Web Coverage Services (WCS). These services running on internet servers provide online geoinfomation on demand. When using Web Services in a GIS the current map extent is sent to the linked service which responds with the concerning information for the map section currently shown. The communication is done via standardized protocols.

The federal state NRW provides many Web Services to dessiminate geodata:
